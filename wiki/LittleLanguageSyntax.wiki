{{{

element ::= widget_type [options] [element+] .

= Details =

  * a widget spec consists of an optional set of *macros* and one or more child *elements*
  * an *element* consists of:
    * a *widget_type* (one of the Tkinter standard widgets, i.e. Text, Label, Button, etc...)
    * an optional set of *options* for the widget.
    * an optional set of child *elements* for the widget (this only makes sense for Frame widgets though.)
    * a trailing dot *.*
  * both *options* and *macros* consist of one or more *equates*
  * *equates* are either:
    * _thing = thing_
    * _thing = "quoted string"_

== Additionally ==
*widget_types* are case-INsensitive;  *macros* are substituted for values of *equates* in each *element*; whitespace is not syntactically significant, you can indent your text as you like, you can even put things all on one line...
